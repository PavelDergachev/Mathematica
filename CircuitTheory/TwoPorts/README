You will need a licensed version of Mathematica. You should run the notembook file TwoPortTest.nb, which will require the package TwoPort.m, which in turn is generated from the notebook TwoPort.nb. All files are in ASCII format. Try out the basic usage example in the notebook, which gets a minimal example going. If you manage to develop a particularly neat example, I would appreciate a copy to include in the test file. PLEASE IGNORE the TwoPortScratchpad.nb file, it is simply a place where I keep unfinished business.
