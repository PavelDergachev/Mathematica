You will need a licensed version of Mathematica, I used Version 12. You should run the notembook file BiotSavartTest.nb, which will require the package BiotSavart.m, which in turn is generated from the notebook BiotSavart.nb. All files are in ASCII format. Try out the basic usage example in the notebook, which gets a minimal example going. If you manage to develop a particularly neat example, I would appreciate a copy to include in the test file.
